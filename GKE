#### Follow-on learning links
- For filling in networking gaps, consider the [Fundamentals of computer networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn.
- I like this external [Subnet mask cheat sheet](https://cnes.com/subnets.html) link because I hate trying to make my brain process CIDR notation.
- That said, you should understand the basics of CIDR notation. :) Check out [this post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/configuring-azure-virtual-network-subnets-with-cidr-notation/ba-p/2047809) for help.
- You can try the [Cloud Logging on Kubernetes Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/10910?parent=catalog) lab, which will use up some of your Cloud Skills Boost credits but might be relevant. I unfortunately can't point you to anything with Cloud IDS and GKE, but we can discuss bespoke training content if that's something you decide to pursue. :) I also think this quest might be useful, [Google Cloud's Operations Suite on GKE](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/quests/133). 
#### Deprecations
- For GKE, [PodSecurityPolicies](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deprecations/podsecuritypolicy) are being deprecated and there are a few different alternatives linked there. We tend to go Gatekeeper/Autopilot but there's no firm best practise so it's down to what works for your business.
#### Stay in touch :)

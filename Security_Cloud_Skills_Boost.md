#### Follow-on learning links
- You can try the [Cloud Logging on Kubernetes Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/10910?parent=catalog) lab, which will use up some of your Cloud Skills Boost credits but might be relevant. I unfortunately can't point you to anything with Cloud IDS and GKE, but we can discuss bespoke training content if that's something you decide to pursue. :) I also think this quest might be useful, [Google Cloud's Operations Suite on GKE](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/quests/133). 
#### Deprecations
- So annoying, I know! :) But inevitable in the world of tech. [Cloud Debugger](https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/deprecations) is disappearing, and Snapshot Debugger (the suggested replacement) too. I'll update when a good final choice emerges. For GKE, [PodSecurityPolicies](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deprecations/podsecuritypolicy) are being deprecated and there are a few different alternatives linked there. We tend to go Gatekeeper/Autopilot but there's no firm best practise so it's down to what works for your business.

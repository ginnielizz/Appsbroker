#### Follow-on learning links
- For filling in networking gaps, consider the [Fundamentals of computer networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn. You need to remember that there are some fundamental differences across these clouds about how networks work, such as that networks are global in Google Cloud, but this still gives you some great foundational basics.
- I like this external [Subnet mask cheat sheet](https://cnes.com/subnets.html) link because I hate trying to make my brain process CIDR notation.
- That said, you should understand the basics of CIDR notation. :) Check out [this youtube video]([figurinidr-notation/ba-p/2047809](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POPoAjWFkGg&t=1s)) for help.
- You can try the [Cloud Logging on Kubernetes Engine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/10910?parent=catalog) lab, which will use up some of your Cloud Skills Boost credits but might be relevant. I unfortunately can't point you to anything with Cloud IDS and GKE, but we can discuss bespoke training content if that's something you decide to pursue. :) I also think this quest might be useful, [Google Cloud's Operations Suite on GKE](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/quests/133). 
#### Deprecations
- For GKE, [PodSecurityPolicies](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deprecations/podsecuritypolicy) are being deprecated and there are a few different alternatives linked there. We tend to go Gatekeeper/Autopilot but there's no firm best practise so it's down to what works for your business.
